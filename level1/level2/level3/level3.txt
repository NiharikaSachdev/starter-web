I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you
