Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.

Never let anyone know what you are thinking. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Friends and money - oil and water.

I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.
